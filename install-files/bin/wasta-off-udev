# wasta-off-udev

#   This script launches wasta-off-usb-autolaunch.  The reason for this
#       wrapper script is because udev must not be held up or else the USB
#       device is not ever mounted.  The mount needs to be finished to determine
#       the owner of the device in order to know the x-display-server to launch
#       wasta-backup on.
#
#   2014-03-21 rik: Initial script
#   2014-03-31 rik: renamed to "wasta-off-udev" so that "pgrep wasta-offline"
#       won't return PID of this script
