Description: Offline software updates and installs.
 .
 Wasta-offline modifies the current computer's "software sources" (or apt
 software repositories) to add local repositories from a wasta-offline
 folder.
 .
 This wasta-offline folder can include both "local cache" and "apt-mirror"
 repositories.
 .
 The "wasta-offline local cache repository" consists of software packages
 from another computer's local apt cache of installed software, which is
 loaded into the wasta-offline folder using "wasta-offline-setup".
 .
 "wasta-offline apt-mirror repositories" are "full mirrors of all software
 available in corresponding internet repositories."  They are loaded into
 the wasta-offline folder using "apt-mirror".  The defined "base path" for
 apt-mirror needs to be set to "wasta-offline/apt-mirror", so that
 wasta-offline will know where to find these "wasta-offline apt-mirror
 repositories."  For example, then, a "wasta-offline apt-mirror repository"
 of the main wasta-Linux PPA would be in this folder:
 .
 wasta-offline/apt-mirror/mirror/ppa.launchpad.net/wasta-linux/wasta
 .
 Once the apt sources are modified to prefer these wasta-offline
 repositories, a zenity GUI window is kept open while a user performs any
 desired local software updates and installs with other utilities such as
 MintUpdate, Synaptic Package Manager, etc.  The user has the option to 
 disable internet sources, and ONLY use the offline packages.
 .
 After all wasta-offline local software updates and installs are complete,
 when the GUI window is closed , the current computer's "software sources"
 (apt software repositories) are restored to their original settings.
